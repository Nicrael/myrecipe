How to make kombutcha

We need to start from commercial one. The more the sediment and the freshness, the better.
Heat some water and make some black or green tea. Add 100g of sugar for each liter of water you heated.
Let the water cool down. After it's below 40 degrees pour the konbutcha into it. 
Put everithing in an open container and cover with a coton compress to leave it breath.
Let it be for at least 3 weeks, better if at temperature around 25 degrees.
