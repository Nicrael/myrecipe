![kombutcha](https://poppyswildkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/scoby-how-to-grow-recipe.jpg)

## starting from commercial one

### Ingredients
- 1 liter of water
- 200g of sugar
- 1 liter of commercial kombutcha

### First fermentation
1. Heat the water, dissolve the sugar in it and infuse some black or green tea generously.
1. Let the water cool down to at least 35 degrees.
1. Pour the commercial kombutcha into the water.
1. Put everything in an open container and cover with a cotton compress to let it breath.
1. Let it ferment for at least 3 weeks at a temperature around 25-30 degrees.
1. At this point a scoby should have formed, if not let it ferment more.
1. Remove the scooby and discard 1/2 of the liquid.
1. Repeat the steps from 1. to 4. but this time use the scoby instead of the commercial kombutcha.
1. Let it ferment for at most 1 week.
1. Take half of the liquid to drink and use the remaining half to start a new fermentation along with the scoby.


### Notes
- If it's too sweet, let it ferment more.
- If it's too sour, it's probably become vinegar.
